# Pokemon-Gallery

> A React-Redux project that displays pokemon cards using PokeAPI with cool vaperwave, sci-fi, and medieval style.

The inspiration for the styling came while I was listening to a death metal song called "Lai Lai Hei" by a finnish band called "Ensiferum" which you can see on the medieval panel on the preview page that displays the poke's abilities, Then later I was listening to DOOM ETERNAL OST while I was riping and tearing some code I got the inspiration to use SCI-FI theme to display the cards. Lastly, I was relaxing with some Synthwave retrowave music and you can see this on the background image.
